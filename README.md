Breast cancer is a dangerous disease for women. If it does not identify in the early-stage then the result will be the death of the patient. It is a common cancer in women worldwide. Worldwide near about 12% of women affected by breast cancer and the number is still increasing.The doctors do not identify each and every breast cancer patient.

GOAL of the PROJECT:-
We have extracted features of breast cancer patient cells and normal person cells. As a Machine learning engineer / Data Scientist has to create an ML model to classify malignant and benign tumor. To complete this ML project we are using the supervised machine learning classifier algorithm.

Conclusion:- To get more accuracy, we trained all supervised classification algorithms but you can try out a few of them which are always popular. After training all algorithms, we found that Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers are given high accuracy than remain but we have chosen XGBoost.
